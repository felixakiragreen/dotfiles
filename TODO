DOT modifications:
  [ ] ignore brew when doing stuff
  [ ] ignore the macos stuff

Not working correctly:
  [ ] oh-my-zsh install
  macos/system.json:
    [x] universalaccess
      defaults write com.apple.universalaccess closeViewScrollWheelToggle -bool true # enable
      defaults write com.apple.universalaccess closeViewScrollWheelModifiersInt -int 262144 # set to ^
  oh-my-zsh/install.sh:
    [ ] produces error: 
      ln: /themes/spaceship.zsh-theme: No such file or directory
  Brewfile:
    [ ] mas not working because of AppleId
    [ ] don't try to install/overwrite any apps if they already exist

Figure out how to move preferences for:
  [x] Vscode
    [x] settings.json
    [x] keybindings.json
    [ ] extensions
  [x] iTerm

Eventually:
  [ ] neovim
