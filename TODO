DOT modifications:
	[ ] ignore brew when doing stuff
	[ ] ignore the macos stuff

Not working correctly:
	[ ] fast keyboard repeat isn't working on new computer
	macos/system.json:
		[x] universalaccess
			defaults write com.apple.universalaccess closeViewScrollWheelToggle -bool true # enable
			defaults write com.apple.universalaccess closeViewScrollWheelModifiersInt -int 262144 # set to ^
		[ ] auto lock isn't working
		[ ] screensaver trigger in bottom left corner not working
	oh-my-zsh/install.sh:
		[ ] produces error: 
			ln: /themes/spaceship.zsh-theme: No such file or directory
	Brewfile:
		[ ] mas not working because of AppleId
		[ ] don't try to install/overwrite any apps if they already exist
		[]

Figure out how to move preferences for:
	[x] Vscode
		[x] settings.json
		[x] keybindings.json
		[ ] extensions
	[x] iTerm

Eventually:
	[ ] neovim
